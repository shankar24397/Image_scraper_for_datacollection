# Image_scraper_for_datacollection

This is a very traditional way of getting the data from google using selenium and requests.

This image scraper is used to collect data by entering a google query, The data scraped can be used for multiple deep learning problems.
further Augmentation of images can be done while training the model using our scraped images.\\\


How to use my code:
1.Download the required libraries
2.Download webdriver(i'm using chromedriver ) and set the path.
3. change the subject of query & Number of images to download.
4. Run.


Internally it extracts all the links and then download the images from those links.

Hope it helps.
